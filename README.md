dynamo-table
------------

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mhart/dynamo-table.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mhart/dynamo-table)

A lightweight module to map JS objects and queries to
[DynamoDB](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/API.html)
tables (supports the latest API version, 2012-08-10).

This builds upon the [dynamo-client](https://github.com/jed/dynamo-client)
module, although any client that supports a simple `request` method will also
work.

```javascript
```

API

Installation
------------

With [npm](http://npmjs.org/) do:

npm install dynamo-table
```

Thanks

[dynamo-client](https://github.com/jed/dynamo-client) lib!
